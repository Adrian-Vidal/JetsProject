# JetsProject

## Overview
- Create an AirField containing multiple sub classes of Jets (main Jet class being an abstract class). Also create a JetsApplication where the user is given options such as list fleet, fly all jets view fastest jet, etc. Be sure to start with an empty airfield.
- Create two interfaces (one for cargo jets and one for fighter jets). Make sure only the designated aircraft uses the interface that is called (example: passenger jet and fighter jet should not be called during the load cargo jets method).


## Technologies used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism
	- Abstract
- Interface
- ArrayList
- Eclipse
- Github
- Terminal

## Lessons Learned
- Learned how to implement an interface for use on certain subclasses. Also learned how to use an ArrayList to store, add and remove objects. Otherwise, we used a lot of the same processes used in animal sanctuary so it was good to reuse what we've learned.
